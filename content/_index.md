## Activities

### FD Seminar

I am one for the organisers of the [FD Seminar](https://www.fd-seminar.xyz), an online seminar on representation theory of quivers and finite-dimensional algebras.

### FDLIST

Since May 2021, I am one for the maintainers of the [FDLIST](https://fdlist.math.uni-bielefeld.de), an information list that provides a forum for the exchange of information, ideas, problems and questions, which are related to representation theory of finite-dimensional algebras.

### Network on Silting Theory

I am a member of the [Network on Silting Theory](https://networkonsilting.wordpress.com/), which is funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG.

### Learning seminar

Together with [Bernhard Keller](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~bernhard.keller/indexe.html) (Université Paris Cité) I organise an online _Learning Seminar on Higher Category Theory and its Applications to Algebra and Geometry_. At the moment this is private seminar; if you are interested in participating please contact either Bernhard or myself by e-mail.
