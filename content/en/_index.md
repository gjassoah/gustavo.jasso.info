## Activities

### Cologne Algebra and Representation Theory Group

I am a member of the [Algebra and Representation Theory Group](https://www.mi.uni-koeln.de/RepTheory/) at the University of Cologne. Visit the link to learn about our activities.

#### Current and upcoming activities

[Köln Algebra and Representation Theory Seminar (Oberseminar)](https://sites.google.com/view/oberseminar-algebra-koeln/home)

[ARTA X Advances in Representation Theory of Algebras](https://sites.google.com/view/arta-x-cologne)

### Monday Seminar on Higher Structures

Our research group meets every Monday 10:00-11:30 during the lecture period to hold informal discussions led by one of the participants on topics related to higher structures, or to present our ongoing research. For more information please see the [course catalogue](https://www.mi.uni-koeln.de/KVV/aktuell.pdf).

### Learning seminar on Higher Category Theory

Together with [Bernhard Keller](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~bernhard.keller/indexe.html) (Université Paris Cité) I organise an online _Learning Seminar on Higher Category Theory and its Applications to Algebra and Geometry_. At the moment this is private seminar; if you are interested in participating please contact either Bernhard or myself by e-mail.

### FDLIST

Since May 2021, I am one for the maintainers of the [FDLIST](https://fdlist.math.uni-bielefeld.de), an information list that provides a forum for the exchange of information, ideas, problems and questions, which are related to representation theory of finite-dimensional algebras.

### FD Seminar

I was one for the organisers of the [FD Seminar](https://www.fd-seminar.xyz), an online seminar on representation theory of quivers and finite-dimensional algebras. The seminar ran from May 2020 until May 2024.

The recordings of most talks that took place at the FD Seminar can be streamed from the seminar's [BigBlueButton Server](https://bbb.fd-seminar.xyz) (account required).
